<h1>Software Development Plan</h1>
<div style="background-color:Cornsilk">
<h2>Requirement Specifications:</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I needed to write a weather app with the Vue framework. I already know basic JS so learning Vue felt pretty natural. The biggest challenge that I forsee is the data binding in order to get the colors to work when you click on the div and also updating the counter. I'm going to need an algorithm that will toggle the div's class.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:GhostWhite">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I really only made one function called <code>toggle</code> which takes in just one parameter, <code>ev</code> which describes the event. The function will handle changing states and updating the counters for likely, unlikely, and neutral.</p>
<div style="background-color:DodgerBlue">
<h2>Implementation:</h2>
<p>My code for <code>toggle</code> is:</p>
		<div class="box">
		  <pre>
			<code>
                toggle(ev) {
                    let idx = ev.currentTarget.getAttribute('data-index');
                    let forecast = this.forecasts[idx];
                    if (forecast.state == "neutral") {
                        forecast.state = "likely";
                        this.likely++;
                        this.neutral--;
                        console.log(this.likely);
                    } else if (forecast.state == "likely") {
                        forecast.state = "unlikely";
                        this.likely--;
                        this.unlikely++;
                    } else {
                        forecast.state = "neutral";
                        this.unlikely--;
                        this.neutral++;
                    }

                }
        	</code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>This method was unexpectedly difficult to think about but not necessarily difficult to write. Once I got going, it was easy to finish.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:MediumOrchid">
<h2>Testing & Debugging:</h2>
<p>I didn't have too many bugs but I did face a bug with getting a 400 error while trying to fetch the weather. I'm not sure why I had this error because I wrote the code on Sunday for the fetch after creating my account to get my API key on Friday but I tested it on Tuesday after making no changes and it just worked. The other bugs I encountered were related to me forgetting to use the <code>this</code> keyword.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:PeachPuff">
<h2>Deployment:</h2>
<p>All of the required files are on my GitLab repository and the code is working.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:PaleGreen">
<h2>Maintenance:</h2>
<p>I'm actually pretty proud of how I wrote this program because of all of the reading I did of the documentation for the APIs. Unless they change the way that Vue works or how the APIs are used, my app should continue to work.</p>
